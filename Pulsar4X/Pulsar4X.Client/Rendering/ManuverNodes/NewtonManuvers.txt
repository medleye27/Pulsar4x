This file explains how I'm intending to implement newton manuvers. 

We need to describe:


A Manuver Node 
    this describes how much thrust in the prograde & radial directions.
    
An Orbit
    this describes the orbit the object is on, before, and after the manuver. 
    This is just kepler elements.
   
An Orbit Segment:
    this is an orbit arc between two Manuvers, at it's most basic it's two time positions on an Orbit.
    However we're going to use this to also hold the ui drawing code.  
    
    
Manuver Sequence:
    This is basicaly a ui object, to accomplish manuvers a ship really just needs a flat list of manuvers 
    and when they should happen. however in the ui multiple manuvers kind of should be grouped together into a tree.
    For example:
    Get To Luna orbit (from Earth orbit)
        |_PhaseChange Manver
            |_Manuver 1
            |_Manuver 2
        |_Homman Manuver
            |_Manuver 1
            |_Manuver 2
