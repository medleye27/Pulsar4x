# Welcome to Pulsar4x.

A fan-made project to recreate a more user-friendly and better optimized version of Aurora, a 4x space sim created by Steve Walmsley. Pulsar4x is developed in C#. The long term goal of the project was originally to reproduce a feature-complete clone of Aurora. However, due to Steve Walmsley picking up development on his own C# version of Aurora, this has started to veer off on its own path, and has become a flexible, moddable aurora-like engine.

* Fix issue.
